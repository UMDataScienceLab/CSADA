This repository stores the code for the paper _Rethinking Cost-sensitive Classification in Deep Learning via Adversarial Data Augmentation_ (available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11739). This paper proposed a method that makes deep neural networks cost-sensitive by generating directed adversarial examples.

Experiments were done on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and our medical image dataset (labeled NLM in the repository). 

The pre-trained baselines we use to train cost-sensitive deep networks can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/19cMQjDOhZKrql7Vsmq0UPAMxvFgI12Xp/view?usp=sharing (GitHub does not allow files larger than 25MB). Recall to download the pretrained baseline files to replicate our exact results as expetrimental results depend on the specified cost structures and baseline models.
